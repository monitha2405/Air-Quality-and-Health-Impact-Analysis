# Air Quality and Health Impact Analysis

This project analyzes and visualizes air quality data to understand potential health impacts. Using RapidMiner for machine learning prediction and Power BI for visualization, the dataset explores environmental conditions affecting public health.

## Project Structure
- Dataset: Contains the air quality dataset (from Kaggle)
- workflows: RapidMiner prediction model
- Visualizations: Power BI dashboards (.pbix)

## Dataset Information
- Name: Air Quality and Health Impact Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - by Rabie El Kharoua](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/air-quality-and-health-impact-dataset)

- (The dataset from kaggle is also attached in this repository as you can use them :)

## Tools Used
- RapidMiner – Predictive modeling.
- Microsoft Power BI – Visual analytics / dashboards.

## Key Insights
- Predicted potential health impacts based on AQI and pollutants
- Identified trends using time-based and category filters
- Visualized Predicted Impact Class Vs Health Impact Class
- Mapped pollution intensity for different weather conditions
